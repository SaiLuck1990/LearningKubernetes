# Autoscaling Spring Boot with the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and custom metrics on Kubernetes

## Prerequisites

You should have minikube installed.

You should start minikube with at least 4GB of RAM:

```bash
minikube start \
  --memory 4096 \
  --extra-config=controller-manager.horizontal-pod-autoscaler-upscale-delay=1m \
  --extra-config=controller-manager.horizontal-pod-autoscaler-downscale-delay=2m \
  --extra-config=controller-manager.horizontal-pod-autoscaler-sync-period=10s
```

> If you're using a pre-existing minikube instance, you can resize the VM by destroying it an recreating it. Just adding the `--memory 4096` won't have any effect.

You should install `jq` â€” a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.

You can find more [info about `jq` on the official website](https://github.com/stedolan/jq).

## Installing Custom Metrics Api

Deploy the Metrics Server in the `kube-system` namespace:

```bash
kubectl create -f monitoring/metrics-server
```

After one minute the metric-server starts reporting CPU and memory usage for nodes and pods.

View nodes metrics:

```bash
kubectl get --raw "/apis/metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/nodes" | jq .
```

View pods metrics:

```bash
kubectl get --raw "/apis/metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/pods" | jq .
```

Create the monitoring namespace:

```bash
kubectl create -f monitoring/namespaces.yaml
```

Deploy Prometheus v2 in the monitoring namespace:

```bash
kubectl create -f monitoring/prometheus
```

Deploy the Prometheus custom metrics API adapter:

```bash
kubectl create -f monitoring/custom-metrics-api
```

List the custom metrics provided by Prometheus:

```bash
kubectl get --raw "/apis/custom.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1" | jq .
```

## Package the application

You package the application as a container with:

```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env)
docker build -t spring-boot-hpa .
```

## Deploying the application

Deploy the application in Kubernetes with:

```bash
kubectl create -f kube/deployment
```

### Full set of command to package and deploy application using kubernetes

To connect docker client to minikube**

```bash
minikube docker-env
```
To point your docker client to the docker daemon inside the minikube VM by running this command first**

```bash
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

```bash
docker build -t spring-k8s-hpa .
```

```bash
docker images | grep spring
```

```bash
kubectl create -f kube/deployment
```

```bash
kubectl get pods -l=app=queue
```

```bash
kubectl get pods -l=app=fe
```

```bash
kubectl get pods -l=app=be
```

```bash
minikube service frontend
```

```bash
minikube service backend
```

```bash
kubectl scale --replicas=5 deployment/backend
```

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

```bash
kubectl scale --replicas=1 deployment/backend
```

```bash
kubectl get all
```

**To delete pods**

```bash
kubectl delete deployment.apps/backend service/backend
```
```bash
kubectl delete deployment.apps/frontend service/frontend 
```


You can visit the application at http://minkube_ip:32000

> (Find the minikube ip address via `minikube ip`)

You can post messages to the queue by via http://minkube_ip:32000/submit?quantity=2

You should be able to see the number of pending messages from http://minkube_ip:32000/metrics and from the custom metrics endpoint:

```bash
kubectl get --raw "/apis/custom.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/default/pods/*/messages" | jq .
```

## Autoscaling workers

You can scale the application in proportion to the number of messages in the queue with the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. You can deploy the HPA with:

```bash
kubectl create -f kube/hpa.yaml
```

You can send more traffic to the application with:

```bash
while true; do curl -d "quantity=1" -X POST http://minkube_ip:32000/submit ; sleep 4; done
```

When the application can't cope with the number of incoming messages, the autoscaler increases the number of pods in 3 minute intervals.

You may need to wait three minutes before you can see more pods joining the deployment with:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

The autoscaler will remove pods from the deployment every 5 minutes.

You can inspect the event and triggers in the HPA with:

```bash
kubectl get hpa spring-boot-hpa
```

## Notes

The configuration for metrics and metrics server is configured to run on minikube only.

**You won't be able to run the same YAML files for metrics and custom metrics server on your cluster or EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.**

Also, there are secrets checked in the repository to deploy the Prometheus adapter.

**In production, you should generate your own secrets and (possibly) not check them into version control.**

If you wish to run metrics and custom metrics server in production, you should check out the following resources:
